# The-Budget-Blueprint

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing how the government allocates resources across different sectors over time, and how these allocations align with national priorities, economic objectives, and fiscal management strategies.

The tools used in this project include **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**. The analysis is presented through four interactive dashboards, which offer insights into the data and help illustrate key trends and patterns in government spending across various sectors.
