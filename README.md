# The-Budget-Blueprint

This project focuses on understanding and analyzing how the government allocates resources across various sectors over time, and how these allocations align with national priorities, economic objectives, and fiscal management strategies.

Using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI, I created four interactive dashboards to present the analysis:

Sector Trend Analysis: This dashboard tracks the trends in sector allocations over time, highlighting changes in funding and identifying patterns related to the government’s focus on different sectors.

Sector Analysis: This analysis provides a detailed breakdown of resource distribution across key sectors, helping to assess the relative importance and growth of various sectors in the economy.

Sector Prioritization: The dashboard evaluates the prioritization of sectors based on the allocation trends, offering insights into the government’s strategic focus and decision-making processes.

Fiscal Deficit: This dashboard analyzes the fiscal deficit and its impact on sector allocations, helping to understand how government borrowing and fiscal management affect the distribution of resources.
